              	<p>I like to run, but like most people, I have trouble with the motivation. I found that setting goals and tracking them help me maintain interest. In the past I had tracked only miles, but was interested to see where I ran and how frequently I ran there.</p>
                <p>Currently my process is not as automated as I would like. I track as much data from my runs as I can using my <a href="https://flic.kr/p/qkhKkE" target="_blank">Nike+ SportWatch</a>. Next, because Nike development doesn’t let me have easy access to my own data, I manually transfer the time and distance values to a Google spreadsheet and the running routes to an Illustrator file. I then save a single image file of my route tracking and dump it into a container on my current run tracking website.</p>
                <p>The improvement I made to the 2016 run data collecting is the ability to see how frequently I run on various roads. The more opaque a running route becomes, the more I have been on that portion of roadway. This helps add a layer of information in addition to simply whether or not I have run on a road or not.</p>

                	<li>Can I can eliminate the manual map making portion of this data collection?</li>
                    <li>Can I use DJ.js to plot route data to a map?</li>
                    <li>Keep checking to see if Nike changes their policy since I do already own the watch.</li>
